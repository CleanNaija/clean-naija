1. Set up the project so that it works locally.
Steps:
* install pnpm;
run `npm install pnpm` on your CLI: This can be done in any directory as it is a global command.
Nb: This is because I used pnpm to set up this project
* navigate to corresponding directory on your local machine for this project i.e "C://Users/[...]/clean-naija/Frontend"
run `pnpm install`: This installs all the dependencies needed to run the project
run `pnpm run dev`: This starts up the server

2. Locate **page.tsx** file under app > login. You can code the form part there.
3. When you're done, commit the changes on this branch to github but don't make a pull request as I still have to handle validation
